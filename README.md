# Research Objectives
The objectives of the study are.      
•	To identify how the machine learning approach will be used in predicting the presence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in patients
•	To critically analyse heart disease patient dataset using the accurate data processing method
•	To critically compare the efficacy of each model (K Neighbours, SVM, Random Forest and Decision Tree) in making predictions
•	Critically evaluate the artefact utilizing cybersecurity strategies, employing the proper techniques, and pinpointing the work's weaknesses and strengths.


# Some key Results

The ROC findings shown in Figure 17 show that the K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Classifier work well, with TPR and FPR both being near to 1. This indicates that these classifiers have a low rate of false positives and false negatives (missing real positive cases) (misclassifying negative cases as positive).
However, the performance of decision tree and random forest classifiers is less impressive. The decision tree has a TPR of 0.46428571 and an FPR of 0.28125, meaning that it frequently misclassifies positive situations as negative and produces many false positives. Like K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest has a TPR of 0.75 and a FPR of 0.1875—both of which are inferior to those algorithms.
Therefore, based on the ROC results provided, it seems that K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Classifier have better performance than Decision Tree and Random Forest
